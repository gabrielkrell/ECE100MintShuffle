 Song data was shamelessly solen from the source code of
 Alex Tam's "Basic tones music player program", (c) 2012 GPL 2.1.  We thank
 Alex for the time he spent transcribing.  Since we did not use his code for
 anything other than the note/octave/duration values (originally stored as 
 an array of "X-Y-Z" strings for use in his program), we have not included
 the GNU GPL.  Consider this closer to a citation ;)
